## AppEngine Template Variables Mini Challenge
### CHALLENGE
* Modify helloworld.py to read a new template parameter called greeting and pass it to the helloworld.html template. 
* Edit your HTML so that it displays the greeting and the name.
* A url like http://localhost:8080/helloworld?name=Norah&greeting=Howdy should say "Howdy Norah!"

### STRETCH CHALLENGE
* Read up on detecting user's location with html [here](http://www.developerdrive.com/2012/01/using-html5-to-determine-user-location/) 
* How could you use this browser feature and some python logic to display a different message based on where the user was located? How could you do it solely in javascript?
